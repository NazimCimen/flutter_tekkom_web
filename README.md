## Overview

This project leverages a unified structure for key pages such as **HomeView**, **OurServices**, **AboutUs**, **CarRepair**,**ReapirMachinery**,**FuelSaving** and **ContactUs**. These pages share consistent design elements and behaviors, including:

- **A Header and Footer** for navigation and branding.
- **A Body section** for unique page content.
- **Consistent scroll-based navigation** for smooth section transitions.
- **A Floating Action Button (FAB)** that appears conditionally based on scroll position, enabling quick navigation back to the top.

To maintain uniformity and adhere to the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle, a **Base Layout Architecture** was implemented. This architecture minimizes redundancy by centralizing shared logic and components, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

## Architecture Components

### 1. BaseStateless
- A reusable base class for stateless widgets.
- Provides utility methods for accessing themes, text styles, and screen dimensions.

### 2. BaseStateful
- A reusable base class for stateful widgets.
- Adds common state management utilities, including optional ViewModel integration.

### 3. BaseLayout
- Serves as the foundation for main pages like
  -  `HomeView`
  -  `ContactView`
  -  `OurServicesView`
  -  `AboutUsView`
  -  `CarRepairView`
  -  `RepairMachineryView`
  -  `FuelSavingView`
- Integrates a **Header**, **Footer**, **Body**, and **FAB logic**.
- Manages the scaffold structure and ties together UI and scroll behaviors.

### 4. BaseMixin
- Adds reusable behaviors, such as:
  - Scroll listener management.
  - Section navigation logic.
  - Header transparency toggling based on scroll position.

---

## Hierarchical Integration of Base Architecture
The main pages derive from BaseLayout, which in turn derives from BaseStateful. This layered approach provides these pages with both a standardized layout (Header, Footer, Body, FAB) and access to essential utilities such as scroll management and optional Provider integration.

Meanwhile, non-main pages or standalone widgets directly inherit from either BaseStateless or BaseStateful, allowing them to utilize shared functionality without the additional structure of BaseLayout.

This design ensures a clear separation of concerns, simplifies code reusability, and provides flexibility for creating pages with varying complexity levels while maintaining uniformity across the application.
